<p>Polish Potato Dumplings (Kopytka) made with mashed potatoes, flour and egg. These dumplings are perfect served with garlic, onion, mushrooms and bacon!
Leftover mashed potatoes can also be used to make delicious cakes or casserole with bacon and cheese.</p>

    <h2>What do you need - ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>4 cups mashed potatoes cold</li>
<li>2 large egg</li>
<li>2 cup all-purpose flour see note</li>
</ul>
    <h2>What to do - instructions</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>  Place mashed potatoes in a mixing bowl. They should be cold, so this is a great way to use up leftover potatoes. </li>
<li> Add egg and flour and mix until the dough comes together. Place dough onto a floured surface and divide into two parts. Roll one part of the dough into a long log and slice into 1.5 to 2" dumplings.</li>
<li> In a large saucepan or pot, boil water and add 1 teaspoon of salt. Add 5 to 8 dumplings at a time to the boiling water and cook until they start to float at the top. Remove and place on a plate. Repeat with remaining dumplings.</li>
<li> You can serve the dumplings right away as a side dish or follow the suggestion below.</li>
<li> In a skillet, heat up 1 tablespoon of olive oil and 1 tablespoon of butter. Add cooked dumplings and cook until golden brown. Remove onto a plate. Add 2 minced garlic cloves, 1 small yellow onion (chopped), 4 slices of bacon (chopped) and 4 white mushrooms (washed, sliced). Saute until fragrant and the bacon is crispy. Toss with dumplings and serve.</li>
